Renders a wireframe chess piece, plus a scrolling line of text for good
measure.  You can rotate the chess piece using the joystick.

This demonstrates:

 - m4vgalib's fast bilevel line drawing code.
 - Perspective projection in single-precision floating point.
 - Mixed text and graphics.
 - Smooth scrolling of text.

This is the most CPU-intensive demo in the set, idling the CPU only 5.14% of the
time.  I've used a couple hacks to keep it locked to 60fps...see if you can
spot them.
