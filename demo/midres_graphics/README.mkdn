Demonstrates a 640x480x1 graphics mode.  This has advantages and disadvantages
compared to the 800x600 mode:

 - For raster graphics, it uses less memory, but...
 - It requires the CPU to be underclocked significantly, to 100.7 MHz.

This demo exists primarily to ensure that the support for 640x480 doesn't rot.
