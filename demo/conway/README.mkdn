Conway's Game of Life
=====================

This demo runs Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton, at full screen
resolution.  This demonstrates:

 1. Page-flipping 800x600x1 bitmap graphics.
 2. Running a computationally intensive task locked to vsync.
 3. The fastest Life algorithm I could find.

This uses slightly less than 100% of the CPU and achieves 28.8 million cell
updates per second -- or about 5.5 cycles per cell, since we underclock to
160MHz for timing reasons.
