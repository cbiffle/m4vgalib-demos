 * We happen to use unsigned integers below to avoid sign-extension surprises
 * when shifting.
 *
 * Note that we don't use stdint-style explicit width integers.  This is to
 * allow this file to be used by programs that don't use any C library.  The
 * sizes of the types below are specified by the ARM C ABI, so it's okay.
